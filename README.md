# BarcodeDetection

A real-time system that detects barcodes of food and drink products using OpenCV and Pyzbar via the user's webcam. Upon detection, it then fetches information from Open Food Facts API to retrieve information about the product's name, brand and nutrient level. Below are some sample barcodes that have been tested.
